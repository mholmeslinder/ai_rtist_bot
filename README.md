# New Musical Artist Names

Python program to generate "new" musical artist names.

Drug names based on a finetuning of OpenAI's GPT-2, fed by [a list of the top 10,000ish artists culled from LastFM's API](https://github.com/mholmeslinder/ai_rtist_bot/blob/master/data/artist_names.txt).

## [bot_ml_repo](https://github.com/mholmeslinder/ai_rtist_bot/tree/master/bot_ml_repo)
This is where the real guts of the project live. First, there's the [dataset](https://github.com/mholmeslinder/ai_rtist_bot/blob/master/bot_ml_repo/new_ai_rtists_dataset.ipynb) notebook, which documents how I used the Last.fm API to create our dataset. 

Then, there's our [GPT-2 Colab notebook](https://github.com/mholmeslinder/ai_rtist_bot/blob/master/bot_ml_repo/new_ai_rtists_GPT_2.ipynb) (make sure to open it in Colab!), which walks through finetuning OpenAI's GPT-2 on the dataset to create our new artists.

Finally, there's our [cleaner](https://github.com/mholmeslinder/ai_rtist_bot/blob/master/bot_ml_repo/cleaner.py), which (really inefficiently) cleans our 'new artist names' and prevents them from containing duplicate items from our original dataset.

## To 'use':

set up your virtualenv with Python 3

```python
$ virtualenv -p=(which python3) hm
$ source hm/bin/activate
```

install the requirements

`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

You can use the `get_tweet()` function in the [generate_artist.py](https://github.com/mholmeslinder/ai_rtist_bot/blob/master/generate_artist.py) module to generate the binary *'real or fake'* questions that the bot tweets.

## The Bot:
The [twitterbot](https://twitter.com/new_ai_rtists) is currently deployed with **Heroku**, though that might change in the future. I'll include updates here.

## Other info:

Don't forget to check out the official new_ai_rtists [twitterbot!](https://twitter.com/new_ai_rtists)

Like this twitterbot?  Learn to set up your own [here.](https://dev.to/emcain/how-to-set-up-a-twitter-bot-with-python-and-heroku-1n39). This tutorial was hugely important and helpful in creating this project.

You can run any of the files containing if __name__ == '__main__', including:

 -  [generate_artist.py](https://github.com/mholmeslinder/ai_rtist_bot/blob/master/generate_artist.py)

from the command line to print the results.
